## Predicting harvest cycles

## Stage 1: Desired Results

By the end of this workshop, you will be skilled at sending data from IoT devices and extracting data from Azure IoT hub. You will also be able to use Machine Learning Studio and work with datasets and datastores.

## Stage 2: Evidence

1. Students will demonstrate their ability by successfully creating an IoT hub, sending data to the hub and extracting data from the hub. A quiz is also included at the end of each milestone section in the slides.

## Stage 3: Learning Plan


1. Get setup by provisioning the necessary resources on Azure.
2. Add and connect IoT devices to your hub
3. Send data from IoT devices for analysis
4. Extract data from hub
5. Develop a model and make a prediction
