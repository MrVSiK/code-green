## Predicting harvest cycles

## Stage 1: Desired Results

By the end of this workshop, you will be skilled at analysing data received from IoT devices and use Azure IoT hub. You will also be able to choose the right model for prediction by comparing the pros and cons of each model.

## Stage 2: Evidence

> List any evaluative criteria and Assessment Evidence. Students will demonstrate their understanding of the concepts by doing the following:

1. Performance Tasks (these are tasks that a student can complete to demonstrate comprehension, such as a quiz or code challenge)

## Stage 3: Learning Plan


1. Get setup by provisioning the necessary resources on Azure.
2. Add and connect IoT devices to your hub
3. Send data from IoT devices for analysis
4. Extract data from hub
5. Develop a model and make a prediction
