# Predicting harvest cycles

## Goals

In this workshop, we will discuss **about the complexities of agriculture and make a simple prediction about the optimum time to harvest crops**.

| **Goal**              | *Predicting the optimum time to harvest crops using ML models trained by data captured by IoT devices*                        |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **What you'll need** | *[Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/), latest version of [Python](https://www.python.org/) and a [Github account](https://github.com/)*|
| **Duration** | *1 hour* |
| **Microsoft Cloud Topics taught** | *Azure IoT Hub, Azure ML* |
| **Slides** | [Powerpoint](slides.pptx) |

## What students will learn

*In this area, describe the scenario and intended solution, paraphrasing what is in the module or creating a brief description here*

Example: Have you ever wanted to visit a museum virtually or explore its collections right from your home computer? In this workshop, use an API, or Application Programming Interface, to learn more about a museum collection.
