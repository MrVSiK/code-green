# Predicting harvest cycles

## Goals

In this workshop, we will discuss *insert your topic*.

| **Goal**              | *Predicting the optimum time to harvest crops using ML models trained by data captured by IoT devices*                                    |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| **What you'll need**          | *[Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/), latest version of [Python](https://www.python.org/) and a [Github account](https://github.com/)* |
| **Duration**                  | *1 hour*                                                                |
| **Microsoft Cloud Topics taught**                  | *Azure IoT Hub, Azure ML*                                                                |
| **Just want to try the app or see the solution?** | *an optional link to the completed project sample app or solution folder*                          |
| **Slides** | [Powerpoint](slides.pptx)

## Pre-Learning

[Introduction to Azure IoT Hub](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/learn/modules/introduction-to-iot-hub/?WT.mc_id=Portal-Microsoft_Azure_Marketplace)

## Prerequisites

*any installations that will be helpful, any hardware or software needed*

## What students will learn

*In this area, describe the scenario and intended solution, paraphrasing what is in the module or creating a brief description here*

Example: Have you ever wanted to visit a museum virtually or explore its collections right from your home computer? In this workshop, use an API, or Application Programming Interface, to learn more about a museum collection.
